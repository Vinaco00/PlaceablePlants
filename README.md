# PlaceablePlants
Spigot Plugin which allows players to place plants and crops on any surface. Which plants and crops are allowed can be configured in the plugin's config.yml file.

Known Issues

- Double sound effects when placed on grass
- Lilypad places twice on click
- Plants placed on top of growing crops (wheat, nether wart, etc.) will break on plant growth
- Sugar Cane and Bamboo break on growth when not on standard block
- Dripleaf breaks on bonemeal when not on standard block

Planned Features (If I can figure it out)

- Toggle block update suppression
- Toggle plant growth suppression unless on proper block
- Option for block place whitelist
- Further update suppression to prevent mass breaking of plants
- Reload command
